        <h1>Favorite CMSC subject so far and why : CMSC 150 because even though I had a hard time with it, the joy and satisfaction that the end results give me are the reason why I chose this subject because the difficulty of making the code becomes worth it.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Favorite GE so far and why : It is ARTS 1 because of the way my professor teaches the subject. He teaches with such proficiency and enthusiasm that even I, as someone who doesn’t necessarily read books on their own, became engrossed and have realized a lot of things through the GE subject. </h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Favorite programming language so far and why : Python, C, and R are the programming languages that I chose because they are the languages that I am most familiar with.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Favorite food : Sisig</h1>
