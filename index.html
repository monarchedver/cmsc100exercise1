        <h1>Favorite CMSC subject so far and why : CMSC 150 because even though I had a hard time with it, the joy and satisfaction that the end results give me are the reason why I chose this subject because the difficulty of making the code becomes worth it.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Favorite GE so far and why : It is ARTS 1 because of the way my professor teaches the subject. He teaches with such proficiency and enthusiasm that even I, as someone who doesnâ€™t necessarily read books on their own, became engrossed and have realized a lot of things through the GE subject. </h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Favorite programming language so far and why : Python, C, and R are the programming languages that I chose because they are the languages that I am most familiar with.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Favorite food : Sisig</h1>
